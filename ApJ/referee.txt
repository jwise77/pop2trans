We have clarified this section:

  The first (Pop III) stars are metal-free and have a large
  characteristic mass.  Previously, these stars were believed to be
  massive, with universally suppressed fragmentation (Abel et al 2002,
  Bromm et al 2002, O'Shea & Norman 2007).  Recently, several studies
  have suggested that while fragmentation at times prior to the
  formation of the first protostar may occur at scales of
  $1000-2000~\mathrm{AU}$, such fragmentation is likely to result in
  high-mass, low-multiplicity groups (Turk et al 2009, Stacy et al
  2010).  Subsequent studies have suggested that at later times,
  subsequent to the formation of the first protostar, additional
  fragmentation may proceed (Greif et al 2011, Clark et al 2011).

We have clarified this section:

  Simulations following the full accretion history of Pop III stars,
  from their formation inside cosmological minihalos through
  transitioning onto the main sequence, are not currently possible.
  However, under the assumption of spherical accretion, reasonable
  estimates of the mass ranges for Pop III stars can be made by
  extrapolating forward in time the instantaneous accretion rate at
  the time of formation of the first protostellar core and comparing
  the timescales for accretion against the Kelvin-Helmholtz time.
  Several studies, conducting this extrapolation, have shown that the
  characteristic mass of Pop III stars M_char ~ 100 Msun (Abel et
  al. 2002; Bromm et al. 2002; O'Shea & Norman 2007; Yoshida et
  al. 2008).

We have split this section into two subsections, each one focusing on
Pop III and Pop II star formation prescriptions.  We have described
the methods in more detail, adding all of the star formation criteria
and reasons why they differ from the original Cen & Ostriker
prescription.  We have also changed the text to make the description
flow better.

In addition, we split the Stellar Feedback section into Pop III and
Pop II subsections.

The figure is correct, where a purely Pop II enriched region would
appear red (lower-right corner of the colormap) and a purely Pop III
enriched region appears blue.  However, the caption is incorrect that
states Pop II metals are blue and Pop III metals are red.  We have
fixed this error.

We have described the figures in more detail, drawing attention to
relationships between the plot and the processes occurring in halos.
We have removed the reference to the larger 10^5 solar mass open
circle.  Now the caption reads as the following:

  The scatter plots show the metal-enriched (Pop II) star formation
  history of the intense (left) and quiet (right) halos as a function
  of total metallicity, i.e. the sum of metal ejecta from both Pop II
  and Pop III SNe, at z=7.  Each circle represents a star cluster,
  whose area is proportional to its mass.  The open circles in the
  upper right represent 10^3 and 10^4 \Ms~star clusters.  The upper
  histogram shows the SFR.  The right histogram depicts the stellar
  metallicity distribution.  The intense halo shows a large spread in
  metallicity at z>10 because these stars formed in progenitor halos
  that were enriched by different SN explosions.  At z<10, the
  majority of stellar metallicities increase as the halo is
  self-enriched.  The spikes in metallicity at t = 620, 650, and 700
  Myr show induced star formation with enhanced metallicities in SN
  remnant shells.  The dashed lines in the left panel guide the eye to
  two stellar populations that were formed in two satellite halos,
  merging at z=7.5.  The quiet halo evolves in relative isolation and
  steadily increases its metallicity to [Z/H] ~ -2 until there is an
  equilibrium between \textit{in-situ} star formation and metal-poor
  inflows from filaments.

> Section 4, 1st and 4th paragraphs: I find these paragraphs very
> confusing. Please rephrase.

We have reworded the 1st paragraph to the following.

  We have focused on the birth of two galaxies prior to reionization
  with a cosmological AMR radiation hydrodynamics simulation with very
  high spatial (1 pc comoving) and mass resolution (1800 M_sun).  With
  this resolution, we are able to follow the Pop III star formation
  and radiative and chemical feedback effects in hundreds of minihalos
  that contribute to the formation of a protogalaxy.  Supernovae from
  Pop III stars provide the necessary heavy elements for the
  transition to a Population II stellar population, which we have
  directly simulated.  The galaxies simulated here represent a
  population of uncharacterized high-redshift dwarf galaxies, which
  should be detected with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope,
  that should contribute a significant fraction of the ionizing
  photons during reionization.  Recently, a z=8.6 spectroscopically
  confirmed galaxy was found to reside in an \ion{H}{2} region that
  extends beyond 1 Mpc (Lehnert et al. 2010).  However, using the SFRs
  and \lya~continuum as estimators, this galaxy produces enough
  ionizing radiation to create an HII region between
  ~0.1(f_esc/0.1)^{1/3} Mpc and 0.5(f_esc/0.1)^{1/3} Mpc, where f_esc
  is the fraction of ionizing radiation escaping into the IGM.  This
  discrepancy could be caused by undetected satellite dwarf galaxies,
  such ones presented here, that contribute to local radiation field,
  or an ionizing radiation escape fraction near unity (Wise & Cen
  2009; Razoumov & Sommer-Larsen 2010; Paardekooper et al. 2011;
  Yajima et al. 2011).

We have rewritten the 4th paragraph to the following.

  Building upon this idea of a lower metallicity floor, consider a
  pre-galactic halo that has hosted a Pop III star, producing a SN.
  The majority of the gas is ejected into the IGM and re-accretes
  after ~10-50 Myr (Johnson & Bromm 2007; Wise & Abel 2008).  What
  happens if the metallicity is not greater than the critical
  metallicity?  Massive Pop III stars would form again in this halo;
  however, enriching the surrounding IGM with Pop III SNe and ejecting
  material becomes more difficult in halos with M >~ 10^7 M_sun
  (Whalen et al. 2008).  Thus it is more likely for these halos to
  retain more of its gas during star formation episodes and
  self-enrich its host halo and less of the IGM.  This would
  accelerate the transition from Pop III to II in more massive halos.

  We conclude that it only takes one, at most two, SNe from Pop III
  stars in the halo progenitors to complete the transition to
  Population II (Frebel & Bromm 2011).  However, this does not
  prohibit more than two instances of Pop III star formation in halo
  from happening because the stars can produce BHs with little or no
  metal ejecta, keeping the surrounding environment pristine.
  Although we find that Pop III SNe create a floor of ~10^{-3} Z_sun,
  gas with lower metallicities can still exist in nearby halos because
  the metal-rich SN ejecta will mix slowly into dense cores as the
  blastwave overtakes them (Cen & Riquelme 2008).  These environments
  may be the host of true extremely metal-poor star formation, such as
  the recently discovered halo star with all detected metals below
  10^{-4.2} Z_sun (Caffau et al. 2011).

> Section 4, second paragraph, last sentence: I do not believe this is
> the first simulation of its kind that is able to produce a floor of

We have rephrased this sentence to acknowledge previous papers to the
following.

  Our simulation strengthens this claim of a metallicity floor from
  Pop III SNe (see also Tornatore et al. 2007; Karlsson et al. 2008;
  Maio et al. 2011), where our work improves on previous studies by
  resolving star-forming molecular clouds and employing more realistic
  feedback physics, in particular, radiation transport.
