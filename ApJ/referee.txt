We have clarified this section:

  The first (Pop III) stars are metal-free and have a large
  characteristic mass.  Previously, these stars were believed to be
  massive, with universally suppressed fragmentation (Abel et al 2002,
  Bromm et al 2002, O'Shea & Norman 2007).  Recently, several studies
  have suggested that while fragmentation at times prior to the
  formation of the first protostar may occur at scales of
  $1000-2000~\mathrm{AU}$, such fragmentation is likely to result in
  high-mass, low-multiplicity groups (Turk et al 2009, Stacy et al
  2010).  Subsequent studies have suggested that at later times,
  subsequent to the formation of the first protostar, additional
  fragmentation may proceed (Greif et al 2011, Clark et al 2011).

We have clarified this section:

  Simulations following the full accretion history of Pop III stars,
  from their formation inside cosmological minihalos through
  transitioning onto the main sequence, are not currently possible.
  However, under the assumption of spherical accretion, reasonable
  estimates of the mass ranges for Pop III stars can be made by
  extrapolating forward in time the instantaneous accretion rate at the
  time of formation of the first protostellar core and comparing the
  timescales for accretion against the Kelvin-Helmholtz time.  Several
  studies, conducting this extrapolation, have shown that the
  characteristic mass of Pop III stars

We have split this section into two subsections, each one focusing on
Pop III and Pop II star formation prescriptions.  We have described
the methods in more detail, adding all of the star formation criteria
and reasons why they differ from the original Cen & Ostriker
prescription.  We have also changed the text to make the description
flow better.

In addition, we split the Stellar Feedback section into Pop III and
Pop II subsections.

The figure is correct, where a purely Pop II enriched region would
appear red (lower-right corner of the colormap) and a purely Pop III
enriched region appears blue.  However, the caption is incorrect that
states Pop II metals are blue and Pop III metals are red.  We have
fixed this error.

We have described the figures in more detail, drawing attention to
relationships between the plot and the processes occurring in halos.
We have removed the reference to the larger 10^5 solar mass open
circle.

We have rephrased this sentence to acknowledge previous papers to the
following.

"Our simulation strengthensthis claim of a metallicity floor from Pop
III SNe (see also Tornatore et al. 2007; Karlsson et al. 2008; Maio et
al. 2011), where our work improves on previous studies by resolving
star-forming molecular clouds and employing more realistic feedback
physics, in particular, radiation transport."
