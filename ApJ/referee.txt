We have split this section into two subsections, each one focusing on
Pop III and Pop II star formation prescriptions.  We have described
the methods in more detail, adding all of the star formation criteria
and reasons why they differ from the original Cen & Ostriker
prescription.  We have also changed the text to make the description
flow better.

In addition, we split the Stellar Feedback section into Pop III and
Pop II subsections.

The figure is correct, where a purely Pop II enriched region would
appear red (lower-right corner of the colormap) and a purely Pop III
enriched region appears blue.  However, the caption is incorrect that
states Pop II metals are blue and Pop III metals are red.  We have
fixed this error.

We have described the figures in more detail, drawing attention to
relationships between the plot and the processes occurring in halos.
We have removed the reference to the larger 10^5 solar mass open
circle.

We have rephrased this sentence to acknowledge previous papers to the
following.

"Our simulation strengthensthis claim of a metallicity floor from Pop
III SNe (see also Tornatore et al. 2007; Karlsson et al. 2008; Maio et
al. 2011), where our work improves on previous studies by resolving
star-forming molecular clouds and employing more realistic feedback
physics, in particular, radiation transport."
