Here are my responses to the queries in the proof.

Q1: The code is called "grafic" not "graphic".  The existing text is
correct.

Q2: Please change the sentence to "A nearby PISN provides a
metallicity floor of [Z/H] = âˆ’2.8 in the quiet halo, and the first
Pop II stars form with a similar metallicity."

Q4: The arXiv number for this reference is astro-ph/9710187.  It was
never published in a journal.

Q5: Clark et al. (2009), and O'Shea et al. (2004) were never published
in a journal.  Frebel & Bromm (2010) is still in the review process.

Q6: The changes look fine to me.

Q7: Tseliakhovich et al. (2011) was published in MNRAS, vol. 418,
906. Wolcott-Green et al. (2011) was published in MNRAS, vol. 418,
838.

I have the following questions about the redline version.

1. Bottom of page 5: "star formation" was crossed out for the acronym
"SF", which hasn't been defined earlier.  Please change the first
instance to "star formation (SF)".

2. Middle of page 22: "start forming" was changed to "start-forming".
Please revert to the original text.

3. Page 33: "lower metallicity" was changed to "lower-metallicity".
Please revert to the original text.
